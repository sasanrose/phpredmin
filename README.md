PHPRedMin
=========

PHPRedMin is a simple web interface to manage and monitor your Redis.

## Technologies Used

[Nanophp](https://github.com/sasanrose/NanoPHP) framework

[phpredis](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) redis module for PHP

[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) front-end framework

[JQuery](http://jquery.com/) JavaScript library

[Nvd3](https://github.com/novus/nvd3) reusable chart library for d3.JS

## Installation

Just drop phpredmin in your webserver's root directory and point your browser to it (You also need [phpredis](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) installed)

Apache configuration example (/etc/httpd/conf.d/phpredmin.conf):

```ApacheConf
# phpredmin - Simple web interface to manage and monitor your Redis
# 
# Allows only localhost by default

Alias /phpredmin /var/www/phpredmin

<Directory /var/www/phpredmin/>
   AllowOverride All 

   <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
     # Apache 2.4
     <RequireAny>
       Require ip localhost
       Require local
     </RequireAny>
   </IfModule>

   <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
     # Apache 2.2
     Order Deny,Allow
     Deny from All
     Allow from 127.0.0.1
     Allow from ::1
   </IfModule>
</Directory>
```

_Note:_ If your redis server is on an IP or port other than defaults (localhost:6379), you should edit config.php file

### Key-Value Manipulation

#### Search

The search box will let you to easily search keys in the selected database:
_Note:_ Becareful, since this still doesn't support pagination, try to limit your search otherwise if your search result is too long (e.g. *) then your browser might crash.

The search results will be shown to you as a table. In this table besides the basic information about each key, PHPRedMin provides you with some actions:

* Expire (Sets TTL for a key)
* View (Shows keys' value/values and lets you manipulate it/them)
* Rename
* Move (Moves key to another database)
* Delete
